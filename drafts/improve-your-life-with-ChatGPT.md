# 1. Introduction

Imagine arranging a dinner date with a friend. You send a quick text, and they promptly reply with a proposed time. A few exchanged emojis later, your evening plans are set.

In an age where digital communication feels almost as natural as face-to-face conversation, we are continually seeking ways to make our interactions with technology more intuitive and efficient.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a step towards humans communicating with computers as they would with other humans. ChatGPT is a chat application designed with Artificial Intelligence (AI) for generating human-like text based on given prompts. It's a user-friendly assistant that can help you with a variety of tasks, from answering questions, assisting with writing, tutoring in various subjects, brainstorming, and more.

You could technically 'speak' to ChatGPT. However, for it to work, your spoken words must be transformed into text. That's because ChatGPT is an AI chat application built on an advanced AI model known as the "Generative Pre-trained Transformer" or GPT. ChatGPT is a shining example of Large Language Models (LLMs). These LLMs undergo training on vast troves of text data, ranging from books to internet content, including extensive resources like Wikipedia. This immense data training enables them to identify and understand the intricate patterns within human language. Specifically, it thrives in the realm of NLP (Natural Language Processing), aiming to grasp and reproduce the intricacies of natural human language.

NLP encompasses a broad range of tasks:

**Text Classification** - Categorizing input text into predefined groups such as sentiment analysis and topic categorization.

**Automatic Translation** - Translating text from one language to another without human intervention.

**Question Answering** - Providing answers based on a given text.

**Text Generation** - Generating coherent and relevant output text from a given input, known as a prompt.

At its core, ChatGPT is a prediction engine, crafting responses based on the myriad patterns it has observed in its vast training data.

To grasp ChatGPT's capabilities, we first need to define some foundational concepts:

![Hierarchy of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GPT](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/AI-ML-DL-GPT.png)

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Any technique that enables computers to mimic human behavior.

### Machine Learning (ML)

A branch of Artificial Intelligence where computers learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, they use algorithms and statistical models to predict or decide based on the data they're given.

### Deep Learning (DL)

A specialized area within Machine Learning that uses neural networks, inspired by the human brain, to process and interpret complex data. These networks can automatically learn and improve from experience, making them particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition.

### Neural Networks (NN)

Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, a neural network is a computational model designed to process information. It learns and identifies patterns from data, enabling it to make predictions or decisions after sufficient training.

Now that you have an overview of what ChatGPT is, let's explore how to get started with it.

# 2. How To Use ChatGPT

At its core, ChatGPT is designed to be a user-friendly assistant. For general use, you simply engage in a conversation with it, much like texting a friend. You can ask a question or present a topic and it will respond.

> "Never include sensitive personal, business, or customer data in your conversations with ChatGPT."

## ChatGPT User Interface

The user interface for ChatGPT generally involves a text-based interaction, much like a messaging app.

The interface is divided into two sections: the text box and the conversation history.

![ChatGPT UI Two Sections](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/chatgpt-ui-guide-two-sections.png)

### Text Box

The text box is where you enter your prompt so a conversation can begin.

- You can edit your prompt at any time by clicking on the text box and typing in a new prompt.
- You are also able to like or dislike a response by clicking on the thumbs up or thumbs down icon next to the response. This will help ChatGPT learn what you like and dislike so it can provide better responses in the future.
- There is a copy icon next to the thumbs up and thumbs down icons that will copy the response to your clipboard.
- The regenarate icon will generate a new response that is different from the previous response.

### Conversation History

The conversation history is where you can see the conversation between you and ChatGPT. It's a great way to keep track of what you've said and what ChatGPT has said. You can also use it to review your conversation and make sure you're getting the best results.

- The ? icon on the bottom right of the conversation history that will open a help menu. The help menu will provide you with information about ChatGPT and keyboard shortcuts to maximize your efficiency.

Below are two examples of the ChatGPT user interface highlighting important sections of the interface and how they are used.

![ChatGPT User Interface Guide with no history](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/chatgpt-ui-guide-with-no-chat-history.png)

![ChatGPT User Interface Guide with message history and prompt](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/chatgpt-ui-guide-with-chat-history.png)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

ChatGPT has a few keyboard shortcuts. If you begin using them early, they will become second nature and you'll be able to use ChatGPT more efficiently.

![ChatGPT Keyboard Shorcuts](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/chatgpt-keyboard-shortcuts.png)

## Let's get started with a prompt!

> ChatGPT-3.5 will be used throughout the whole course.

A prompt is the text you enter into the text box to start a conversation with ChatGPT. Writing a good prompt helps us get the most out of AI tools like ChatGPT. Prompting is a way to give these AI models direction so it can understand our task and then help us complete it. But to get the best results, you need to know how to craft a good prompt. And most people who struggle with prompting are making the same mistake. They're being too generic and expecting that AI is just going to read our minds.

### Example 1 - Simple Prompt

Let's begin with a simple prompt asking for life advice. "I want to improve my life"

![I want to improve my life - simple prompt](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/example1-simpleprompt.png)

As you can see in this response ChatGPT is a friendly assistant that gives general tips to improve your life. It's not perfect, but it's a good start. Let's try another prompt with a little more context.

### Example 2 - More Context

Let's try a prompt that gives ChatGPT more context. "I want to improve my life by being more productive"

![I want to improve my life - more context](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/example2-morecontext.png)

As we can see, with more context, ChatGPT has more information about the situation, allowing it to respond more specifically to our request. Sometimes we are not sure exactly what we want to ask ChatGPT. In these cases, we can ask ChatGPT to help us.

### Example 3 - Ask me for context

Let's try a prompt that asks ChatGPT for help by having ChatGPT ask questions. "I want to improve my life by being more productive. Can you ask me questions about the context?"

![I want to improve my life - ask me for context](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/example3-askmeforcontext.png)

As seen in the response, even ChatGPT recognizes that asking questions about your current context can help it understand and provide more personalized advice. Instead of asking it to do the task, we now instruct ChatGPT to ask questions about the context.

## Advanced Prompting

All three examples demonstrate why context is important. The more context you give it, the better it can respond to your request. Those are sure to get you started, but let's look at some more advanced prompting techniques. These techniques will transform your ChatGPT experience.

### Prompt Length & Asking for Multiple Things

Now that you're getting better responses, you might be tempted to write a long prompt, asking for 4 or 5 things at once. But this is usually not a good idea, especially if you're using GPT-3.5. ChatGPT works best when you give it one specific thing to focus on at a time, this specific thing can be complex but be sure to stay away from giving it a list of to-dos. It's better to involve an incremental process to get your desired result. GPT-4 on the other hand, can handle longer prompts that request multiple things.

### Conversation Length

Another important thing to know is that each conversation has a maximum "context" length. If you have a long conversation, ChatGPT will always try to use everything in the conversation to generate a response, but if you keep going after its limit, you can keep chatting but the responses will be less and less relevant to the original conversation. This is why it's important to keep your prompts and conversations more focused.

As of July 2023:

- GPT-3.5-Turbo has a maximum context length of 4k tokens, which is roughly 3,000 English words.
- GPT-4 has a maximum context length of 8k tokens, which is roughly 6,000 English words.

### Response Format or Style

Here are some formats or styles you can use to get different types of responses from ChatGPT suited to your needs:

- Direct answer
- List or bullet points
- Dialogue or FAQ
- Essay or article
- Story or poem
- Table or spreadsheet
- Narrative or storytelling
- Code or script
- Analogies or metaphors
- Analysis or commentary
- Quiz or Multiple Choice
- Interview or Q&A
- Chronological or timeline
- Pros and Cons
- Recommendations or suggestions
- Roleplay or Scenario
- Markdown or HTML
- Journal or Diary
- Recipe or Instructions
- Step by Step

Could you think of other formats or styles?

Remember, ChatGPT is tailored to be a user-friendly assistant, but sometimes, you might want to guide it a bit so it understands you better. That's where "One-Shot" and "Few-Shot Learning" come in. Let's simplify these terms.

## One-Shot and Few-Shot Learning

One-shot or Few-shot learning is a technique wherein you provide one or more examples (or "shots") in your prompt to guide ChatGPT's responses. By showing ChatGPT example inputs and outputs for a particular task, you are essentially teaching it how to perform that task in a specific format or structure. The idea is to leverage these examples to steer the AI towards more tailored outputs.

For instance, in this one-shot example, we want ChatGPT to give us a name that matches a color we provide.

![one-shot learning](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/one-shot-learning.png)

In this scenario, ChatGPT learned that we want names that match a color given. One-shot helps tailor the response to our needs. My blue cat now has a name. Azure!

### Advantages of Few-shot Learning

1. **Tailored Responses**: By giving ChatGPT explicit examples, you can guide its answers to fit a particular structure or style. This ensures you get responses that align more closely with your expectations.
2. **In-context Learning**: The examples serve as conditioning, enhancing the performance of the model in the context of the ongoing conversation. By setting the stage with a few examples, you instruct ChatGPT on the kind of outputs you desire.

> Remember, each time you start a new thread or session, these examples should be reintroduced, as ChatGPT retains memory solely within the current context or conversation.

In conclusion, Few-shot prompting with ChatGPT is a potent tool, especially when seeking more refined, structured, or specialized responses. Whether you use one example or a few, you're helping it understand you better. And that makes your chat even more fun and helpful!

# 3. Interactive Workshop

Now that you know how to use ChatGPT, let's explore some ways you can use it to improve your life. We will cover four areas: Creative Art, Journaling, Learning, and Ideation.

## Creative Art

Let's embrace the joy of art appreciation and creation with the help of ChatGPT.

### Art Appreciation

ChatGPT can help you appreciate art by providing context and information about the art you're viewing.

**Objectives**

- Explore various forms of art, such as music and paintings.
- Learn how ChatGPT can be used to gain insights and appreciation.
- Engage in activities that promote mindfulness and emotional connection to art.

**Activities**

### Art Exploration:

- Let's begin by asking for a painting recommended based on a keyword.

`
Please recommend me a painting based on the keyword 'love'`

![art-exploration-keyword-love-painting](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/chatgpt-love-artwork-recommendation-the-kiss.png)

I google searched for "The Kiss" by Gustav Klimt and found this image, courtesy of https://www.gustav-klimt.com/The-Kiss.jsp

![the-kiss-1907-gustav-klimt](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/the-kiss-by-gustav-klimt.png)

> High-resolution image of ["The Kiss" by Gustav Klimt](https://g.co/arts/es7QB9DjFmLueUW78)

Let's ask for more information about this painting.

`Please tell me more about this painting.  I want to appreciate this artwork`

![art-exploration-keyword-love-painting-more-info](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/chatgpt-more-info-the-kiss-1.png)
![art-exploration-keyword-love-painting-more-info](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/chatgpt-more-info-the-kiss-2.png)

As you can see, ChatGPT gave us an overview of the painting along with some information about the artist. It also suggested us how to appreciate the artwork.

You can now use this information to appreciate other artwork. I encourage you to open a new conversation and use a different keyword, mood, style, artitst, color, etc. to explore other artwork.

I certainly enjoy exploring art with ChatGPT. It's a great way but not the only way to learn about art and appreciate it!

#### Listen & Reflect:

- Let's begin by asking for song recommendation based on a mood.

`Please suggest me a song based on the mood 'happy'`

![ChatGPT suggesting Happy by Pharrell Williams for the keyword 'happy'](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/chatgpt-song-suggestion-keyword-happy.png)

I have heard this song before, so I would like to ask for more information about this song.

`Please tell me more about this song. I want to appreciate this song`

![Happy by Pharrell Williams information](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/happy-pharell-williams-song-info.png)

Here we got some great information about what makes this song so uplifting. Let's ask for a similar songs.

`Please suggest me a song similar to this song`

![Song similar to Happy by Pharrell Williams](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/chatgpt-song-suggestions-similar-happy.png)

Here is an even better idea, let's ask for a playlist of similar songs to include for a kids birthday party.

`Suggest me a playlist with similar songs for a kids birthday party.  Do not include songs with explicit lyrics`

![ChatGPT music playlist suggestions for kid birthday no explicit lyrics](../assets/improve-your-life-with-ChatGPT/chatgpt-playlist-happy-bday-suggestion.png)

We now have a great playlist that we can play and adjust to our liking. While there are other ways to find music, ChatGPT can serve as a great tool to find and learn about music.

I encourage you to open a new conversation and find a music style that you like and explore it with ChatGPT. I've used ChatGPT for interpreting lyrics, finding new music, creating playlist, and learning about music.

### Art Creation

Now that we got some ideas on how to appreciate art, let's explore how we can create art with ChatGPT.

## Journaling

### Free Writing

### Gratitude Journal

## Learning

### Education

### Interview

## Ideation

Unlike a human, ChatGPT doesn't get tired or

### Brainstorming

### Start a Business

# 4. Limitations, Ethics, Economy & Future Updates

### An important sidenote about responses

ChatGPT doesn't always give the same answer to the same question. It's based on statistics, so its answers might vary. Remember, it's using information up to September 2021, so it's good to double-check the answers.
You can "Trust, but verify" the responses.

### Beware of AI Hallucinations

What is AI hallucination? It is when the AI thinks something is right, but it is wrong. This can be dangerous for users who rely on ChatGPT. You have to double-check and keep a critical eye on the response.

> If you find an answer is unrelated, please provide that feedback by using the "Thumbs Down" button.

### ChatGPT & Math

ChatGPT has no mathematical capabilities, but it can give a close estimation with a language approach only. That's because its training data included a lot of math text. If you plan to use ChatGPT for math problems, include "Let's think step by step" in your prompt. This allows it to provide itself context and give you a more accurate response.

### Privacy

ChatGPT is not designed to handle sensitive information and your conversation is not private by default, the conversation history can be used to train the model and improve it. If you want to keep your conversation private, you can use the "Private Conversation" feature available only to ChatGPT Plus users.

### Usage Policy

[https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies)

### Commercial Use

Subject to the [Content Policy](https://labs.openai.com/policies/content-policy) and [Terms](https://openai.com/api/policies/terms/), you own the output you create with ChatGPT, including the right to reprint, sell, and merchandise â€“ regardless of whether output was generated through a free or paid plan.

### Bias and Discrimination

ChatGPT is not inherently biased, but the data it was trained on may contain biases that could be reflected in its responses. For example, ChatGPT has produced outputs that are nonsensical, factually incorrect, or even sexist, racist, or otherwise offensive. Careful research is always in order. One should never rely solely on ChatGPT when making important decisions. You can try asking for counterfactual examples to better understand a situation or answer.

### AI Economy

- The global artificial intelligence (AI) market was worth $454.12 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $2,575.16 billion by 2032.
- Some predict that AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030. This is more than the current output of China and India combined.
- Others predict that AI could increase global GDP by 14% in 2030.
- The AI market is growing and predicted to be worth trillions. It could boost the global economy but also disrupt jobs and society. It's exciting but complex, and the actual impact is still uncertain.

It's still hard to predict if more jobs will be created than lost. But it's important to be aware of the potential impact of AI on the economy and society.

### Future ChatGPT

OpenAI the company behind this successful application is constantly coming out with improvements guide by safety and improved user experience. Their goal is to align AI with human interests. When ChatGPT was newly released, many people found ways to "jailbreak" it. This means they found ways to make it do things it was not designed to do. For example, malicious users were able to make it generate racist, sexist, and other offensive text. OpenAI has since improved the model to prevent this from happening and it will continue in the future. AI Safety is a growing concern worldwide, prompting governments and tech companies to speed up collaboration. GPT-5 is suspected to be released in 2024.
