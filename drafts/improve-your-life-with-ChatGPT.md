# Introduction

"I want you to think how you communicate with a friend. It can be through text, email, or in person."

"For example, you might text this friend to ask if they want to go grab dinner later. They respond with a thumbs up emoji and suggest a time. You confirm the time and place, that's it! - plans made!"

ChatGPT is a step towards humans communicating with computers like they would with a human. But how does it work?

ChatGPT is an AI chat application built on top of an AI model called GPT. GPT is a massive AI model that was trained on billions of words across a bunch of books, a lot of the internet and a lot of Wikipedia. GPT uses NLP (natural language processing) a subfield of ML (Machine Learning) to allow it to understand natural language text.

### AI

Any technique that enables computers to mimic human behavior.

You could tecnnically speak to ChatGPT but in order for it work it must be transformed into text. That's because ChatGPT is an LLM (Large Language Model). LLMs analyze or train on very large amounts of text date (internet, books, wikipedia), which allows it to learn patterns and relationships between words in sentences.

Some of the things ChatGPT or NLPs aim to do well are: text classification, automatic translation, question answering, and text generation.

ChatGPT is ultimately a prediction machine. It's response are statistically correct!

### Machine Learning (ML)

A subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical
models to enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based
on data without explicit programming.

# How To Use ChatGPT

At its core, ChatGPT is designed to be a user-friendly assitant. For general use, you simple engage in a conversation with it, much like texting a friend. You can ask a question or present a topic and it will respond.

"Never include personal, business, or customer data in your conversations with ChatGPT." It's not designed to handle sensitive information and your conversation is not private by default, the conversation history can be used to train the model and improve it.

## Let's get started with a prompt!

A prompt is the text you enter into the text box to start a conversation with ChatGPT. Writing a good prompt helps us get the most out of AI tools like ChatGPT. Prompting is a way to give these AI models direction so it can understand our task and then help us complete it. But to get the best results, you need to know how to craft a good prompt.

### Example 1 - Simple Prompt

Let's begin with a simple prompt asking for life advice. "I want to improve my life"

![I want to improve my life - simple prompt](..\assets\example1-simpleprompt.png)

As you can see in this response ChatGPT is a friendly assitant that gives general tips to improve your life. It's not perfect, but it's a good start. Let's try another prompt with a little more context.

### Example 2 - More Context

Let's try a prompt that gives ChatGPT more context. "I want to improve my life by being more productive"

![I want to improve my life - more context](..\assets\example2-morecontext.png)

As we can see, with more context, ChatGPT has more information about the situation, allowing it to respond more specifically to our request. Sometimes we are not sure exactly what we want to ask ChatGPT. In these cases, we can ask ChatGPT to help us.

### Example 3 - Ask me for context

Let's try a prompt that asks ChatGPT for help by having ChatGPT ask questions. "I want to improve my life by being more productive. Can you ask me questions about the context?"

![I want to improve my life - ask me for context](..\assets\example3-askmecontext.png)

Instead of asking it to do the task, we now instruct the ChatGPT to ask questions about the context. If we answer them, it must help it to do better completions.

All three examples show you how context is important to ChatGPT. The more context you give it, the better it can respond to your request. But what if you want to do more than just ask ChatGPT for advice? What if you want to have a conversation with it?

### An important sidenote about responses

ChatGPT by default is not supposed to have determistic responses. This means that asking the same question twice will not always result in the same response. This is because ChatGPT is a statistical model. It's responses are "limited" by the data it was trained on, which stopped at September 2021. You can "Trust, but verify" the responses.

## Beware of AI Hallucinations

What is AI hallucination? Basically, it is when the AI thinks something is right and tells you, “I am right,” but it is actually wrong. This can be dangerous for users who rely on GPT. You have to double-check and keep a critical eye on the model’s response.

### ChatGPT & Math

ChatGPTit has no mathematical capabilities, it can give a close estimation with a language approach only. That's because its training data included a lot of math text. It's not advised to use for math.

# Conclusion & Call to Action

## ChatGPT evolves

OpenAI the company behind this succesful application is constantly improving the model. Their goal is to align AI with human interests. When it was newly released, many people found ways to "jailbreak" it. This means they found ways to make it do things it was not designed to do. For example, malicious users were able to make it generate racist, sexist, and other offensive text. OpenAI has since improved the model to prevent this from happening and it will continue in the future.

## Tips for using ChatGPT

- Keep the prompts clear and concise.
- If you're not happy with the response you get, try rephrasing your prompt or adding more context.
